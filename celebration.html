I really thought I'd end up as a hopeless person, a jerk and a playboy. AS in baby, wala kong trust or hope sa sarili ko dati nung hindi kapa dumadating sa mundo ko. You have turned my whole life around, for the better. Big thanks to you din baby that I returned back to God and am getting closer with him. Grabe ung blessing sakin ni lord na dinala niya ako sa harapan mo, I would never forget that moment when I looked into your eyes and knew deep down in my heart, "Lord siya na po". Mahal na mahal kita My Camila</p>
